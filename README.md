# Rusty

Rusty is a general-purpose Discord moderation bot built with Rust and twilight-rs.

It is intentionally opinionated and message-command focused, slash commands are not part of this project by design.

It focuses on reliable, structured features, with AI-driven conversational interaction planned in the future.

Made for fun and private use.
